SchildiChat is a client for the matrix protocol, based on the Element app.
Compared to other clients, it provides a more classic instant messenger feel, while still providing the full functionality of the reference client.

The matrix protocol is a decentralized approach to modern messaging, allowing for end-to-end encryption, shared message history across multiple devices, and more.

Compared to the Element app, SchildiChat features following changes:
- A unified chat list for both direct and group chats
- Optional message bubbles
- Further usability improvements and additional settings to configure the app
